# Trivia Bros
As with most people right now (March 2020, shelter-in-place), my friends are hanging out over video. One night, we tried to organize a trivia game night. It was an awesome comedy of errors as we talked over each other to the point that we couldn’t hear the questions, failed to decipher each other’s handwriting, and drank a bit too much that keeping score became a challenge.

Trivia Bros is a simple web app to make all of that just a little bit easier. The Quiz Master can write and display questions, players can submit their answers, and TriviaBros helps organize, grade answers, and keep score.

For a new games, please use the `new_game.py` script that will delete any records in the `questions` and `answers` tables.
